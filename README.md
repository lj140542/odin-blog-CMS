This project is part of The Odin Project's NodeJS curriculum. <br/>
The goal of this project was to build a blog and to do so I had to create 3 repos : 
- a website where users will consume posts and comment on them.
- this one, a CMS, that an authenticated user can use to create, update, delete, and publish posts.
- an API, to handle the two previous website to a database, and the authentication for the CMS.
